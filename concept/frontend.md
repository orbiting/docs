## Channels

### Website

This is the primary channel to consume our product and to interact with it, us or each other. And to buy a membership, subscription or donate. And be informed about our events and other important things.

### Newsletter

This is the most important channel to engage members. A newsletter is from a technical point of view something quite simple: an email. What matters is design and targeting. So we will build tools to send newsletters to specific lists of recipients from within the CMS.

### Social Media

We use social media to promote our content. We are present on Facebook and Twitter, where we share our articles, events etc. We'll build good tooling in order to publish and monitor our content on these platforms.

### Mobile App

As a first step we will publish an simple app for iOS and Android, but it is nothing more \(or less\) than the mobile version of the website enhanced with push notifications \(not at least because of it's very high potential of personalization and customization\).

## How to proceed

This is going to be a long, interesting and very collaborative process, where the designers will play a very important role and everybody from the team \(journalists, business, community and event people\) and external experts, testers etc. will be part of. Because it is always easier to build something small and drafty and then improve it in cycles than to discuss everything theoretically and then build it, we want to start with the first cycle right now without further ado and build a first prototype based on requirements and ideas, described in the following documents:

* Outcomes of team workshop on January 31st
* Publizistisches Konzept
* Organisationsstruktur Konzept
* Info architecture concept by Christof/Clara
* The words we specified for Bodara in the brand design process \(Publizistische Heimat etc.\)
* maybe: a list of requirements

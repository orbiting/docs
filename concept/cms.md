# For the Journalists

We have been thinking and talking about this a lot. What we describe in the following is the result of the learnings from the creation and publication process at Project R so far \(mainly newsletters\), our own experience with creating, writing, producing, collaborating on and publishing content, the experiences from working at NZZ and Watson and other \(media\) companies. It is inspired by many other tools such as Living Docs \(the editor of Watson and NZZ\), medium.com and not the least by tools we use as developers to collaborate on code.
